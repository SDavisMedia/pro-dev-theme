What Is This?
=======================

Professional Developers is a free WordPress Theme created to be a one-stop shop 
for software downloads, documentation, change logs, and support.

The theme is not flashy. Styles are kept to a minimum and the focus is kept on
logical functionality.

The ideal user would be some type of software developer (doesn't matter what kind
of software) that has a software to sell or giveaway that requires a place to handle
all needs such as support forums, documentation, changelogs, etc. 


Integration
=======================
The Professional Developer's Theme for WordPress is designed to work with other
software to achieve the above goals. WordPress plugins like Easy Digital Downloads
and bbPress are integrated into the system so that minimal adjustments need to be
made to the theme to use them.
